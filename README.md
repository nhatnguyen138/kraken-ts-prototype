# React/TypeScript Prototype - Kraken WebSocket API

This build is a React/TypeScript app that uses [Kraken Websockets API 1.9.0](https://docs.kraken.com/websockets/) to subscribe realtime data in a web socket, store it and visualise in forms of realtime line graphs.


## Preview

You can check how the build version of this in Netlify. Simply click on [this link](https://live-crypto-ticker-by-nhatnguyen138.netlify.app/).

This whole project is the result within 3 days straight of designing, developing, solving, implementing and deploying. Although this is not my best work and it is nowhere near polished enough, given the limited time I can be quite satified with how I tried to put so many techs onto this build and somehow still managed to finish it.


## Technologies Used

Technologies used including:
1/ ReactJS - with TypeScript template
2/ React Redux
3/ Node SASS
4/ Recharts (to visualise graphs)
5/ WebSocket and localStorage
